* This is a project that uses the repo and class repository to push up class files. Note that it uses the lesson plans readme to break it down into days and there is a typo in week 21 day 3 where it says:

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `11-Ins_Sign-JWT` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* That should read: * In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_Sign-JWT` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* my work arround right now is just to modify that typo manually.

* To add content for new week run "node script.js"

* To add solved content for a day in a week run "node solved ?" replace the question mark with 1, 2, or 3 respective to the current day.
* To push changes run "node push.js"
